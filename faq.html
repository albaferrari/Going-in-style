                    <h2 class="questionA">When and what was the first coffin?</h2>
                    <p class="answerA">One day, a lady knocked on the door. This lady had a
                        half-built coffin in the back of her van. It was in the form of an aeroplane
                        fuselage. She asked us to finish it off. Other people got to hear about this and
                        a trickle of orders came in.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faqB">
                    <h2 class="questionB">How many coffins are made and sold?</h2>
                    <p class="answerB">The interest in our coffins grows year on year. Even so, many
                        customers after discovering the lead times and cost involved, prefer one of our
                        simpler options. There again, quite a few crazy coffins are sold to people who,
                        although presently active and fit, want to have a coffin ready and waiting. It
                        is always an option to order your coffin "pre need" giving us many months or
                        even years to complete your perfect coffin and either store it or deliver it in
                        advance of your needs.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="faqA">
                    <h2 class="questionA">Do we have a range of coffins?</h2>
                    <p class="answerA">Not currently. We tend to build all of our coffins to order
                        from the ground up. The customer says exactly what they want and we make every
                        effort to ensure as little compromise as possible. When someone wants a Ferrari,
                        they don't usually want any old Ferrari. They have a precise model in mind, a
                        specific colour or even a favourite team. They do the thinking - they always
                        know what they want.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faqB">
                    <h2 class="questionB">What do coffins cost?</h2>
                    <p class="answerB">
                        It really depends on what the client wants. It's partly dependant on how quickly
                        it's needed (if you want a piece quickly, it'll probably require lots of
                        overtime working) and partly upon the complexity of the shapes that we have to
                        create. A coffin shaped like a particular motorcar may set you back a
                        considerable amount (ranging in the thousands of pounds), but a simplified
                        football boot may only cost you several hundred pounds. The more elaborate and
                        detailed the designs, the more it is likely to cost.

                <div class="faqA">
                    <h2 class="questionA">
                        Is there any coffin you can't make?</h2>
                    <p class="answerA">Not really, we try to fulfil everyone's wish. A difficult
                        challenge would have been a glass casket for a sleeping beauty coffin and the
                        client pulled out but maybe one day? Given the time to manufacture, all things
                        are possible.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faqB">
                    <h2 class="questionB">What kind of people buy your coffins?</h2>
                    <p class="answerB">
                        Young and old are now thinking about their funeral and how they want to be
                        buried or cremated. How should they make their final journey and how should they
                        celebrate their lives? Income does not determine the type of person that will
                        buy one of our coffins, however lifestyle, hobbies and interests might.
                    </p>

                <div class="faqA">
                    <h2 class="questionA">What materials are used?</h2>
                    <p class="answerA">Our coffins are made from a diverse range of materials. All
                        of the materials are from sustainable timbers and our finishes are solvent free.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="faqB">
                    <h2 class="questionB">Do you have a storage?</h2>
                    <p class="answerB">
                        Some clients request that we store their coffin for them, some take them home
                        and use them as a piece of furniture. When storing clients coffins we are often
                        allowed to use them in exhibitions plus "their story". We presently do not
                        charge for storage.
